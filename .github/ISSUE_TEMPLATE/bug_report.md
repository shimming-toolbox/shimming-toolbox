### Bug Description
<!-- Describe the unexpected behaviour.

If you experience an error, copy/paste the Terminal output (include your syntax) and please follow these guidelines for clarity:

If there are fewer than 10 lines of text, embed them directly in your comment in Github. Enclose it in triple-ticks (```) to format as code.
If there is 10+ lines, either use an external website such as pastebin (copy/paste your text and include the URL in your comment), or use collapsable Github markdown capabilities (https://gist.github.com/ericclemmons/b146fe5da72ca1f706b2ef72a20ac39d#using-details-in-github). -->

### Reproduction Steps
<!-- Steps to reproduce the behavior. Try to reproduce your issue using publicly-available data. If the error is data-specific, upload a zipped version of the data directly into github (not the full dataset, only what's required to be able to reproduce the error). If you cannot provide the file publicly, mention @jcohenadad in the issue description to coordinate. -->
