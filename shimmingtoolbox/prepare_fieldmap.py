    """ Creates fieldmap (in Hz) from phase images. This function accommodates multiple echoes (2 or more) and phase
    difference. This function also accommodates 4D phase inputs, where the 4th dimension represents the time, in case
    multiple field maps are acquired across time for the purpose of real-time shimming experiments.

    Args:
        phase (list): List of phase values in a numpy.ndarray. The numpy array can be [x, y], [x, y, z] or [x, y, z, t].
                      The values must range from [-pi to pi].
        echo_times (list): List of echo times in seconds for each echo. The number of echotimes must match the number of
                           echoes. It input is a phasediff (1 phase), input 2 echotimes.
        affine (numpy.ndarray): 4x4 affine matrix.
        unwrapper (str): Unwrapper to use for phase unwrapping. Supported: prelude.
        mag (numpy.ndarray): Array containing magnitude data relevant for ``phase`` input. Shape must match phase[echo].
        mask (numpy.ndarray): Mask for masking output fieldmap. Must match shape of phase[echo].
        threshold: Prelude parameter used for masking.

    Returns
        numpy.ndarray: Unwrapped fieldmap in Hz.
