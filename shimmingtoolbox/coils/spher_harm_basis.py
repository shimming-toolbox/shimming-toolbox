    """
    The function first wraps ``shimmingtoolbox.coils.spherical_harmonics`` to generate 1st and 2nd order spherical
    harmonic ``basis`` fields at the grid positions given by arrays ``X,Y,Z``. *Following Siemens convention*,
    ``basis`` is then:

        - Rescaled to Hz/unit-shim, where "unit-shim" refers to the measure displayed in the Adjustments card of the
          Syngo console UI, namely:

            - 1 micro-T/m for *X,Y,Z* gradients (= 0.042576 Hz/mm)
            - 1 micro-T/m^2 for 2nd order terms (= 0.000042576 Hz/mm^2)

        - Reordered along the 4th dimension as *X, Y, Z, Z2, ZX, ZY, X2-Y2, XY*

    The returned ``basis`` is thereby in the form of ideal "shim reference maps", ready for optimization.

    Args:
        x (numpy.ndarray): 3-D arrays of grid coordinates, "Left->Right" grid coordinates in the patient coordinate
                           system (i.e. NIfTI reference (RAS), units of mm)
        y (numpy.ndarray): 3-D arrays of grid coordinates (same shape as x). "Posterior->Anterior" grid coordinates in
                           the patient coordinate system (i.e. NIfTI reference (RAS), units of mm)
        z (numpy.ndarray): 3-D arrays of grid coordinates (same shape as x). "Inferior->Superior" grid coordinates in
                           the patient coordinate system (i.e. NIfTI reference, units of mm)
        orders (tuple): Degrees of the desired terms in the series expansion, specified as a vector of non-negative
                        integers (``(0:1:n)`` yields harmonics up to n-th order, implemented 1st and 2nd order)

    Returns:
        numpy.ndarray: 4-D array of spherical harmonic basis fields

    NOTES:
        For now, ``orders`` is, in fact, as default [1:2]â€”which is suitable for the Prisma (presumably other
        Siemens systems as well) however, the 3rd-order shims of the Terra should ultimately be accommodated too.
        (Requires checking the Adjustments/Shim card to see what the corresponding terms and values actually are). So,
        ``basis`` will return with 8 terms along the 4th dim if using the 1st and 2nd order.
