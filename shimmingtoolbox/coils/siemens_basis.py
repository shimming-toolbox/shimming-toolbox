    Get scaling factors for the 8 terms to apply to the (Siemens-reordered) 1st + 2nd order spherical harmonic
    fields for rescaling field terms as "shim reference maps" in units of Hz/unit-shim:

    Gx, Gy, and Gz should yield 1 micro-T of field shift per metre: equivalently, 0.042576 Hz/mm

    2nd order terms should yield 1 micro-T of field shift per metre-squared: equivalently, 0.000042576 Hz/mm^2

    Gist: given the stated nominal values, we can pick several arbitrary reference positions around the
    origin/isocenter at which we know what the field *should* be, and use that to calculate the appropriate scaling
    factor.

    then:

        - Reordered along the 4th dimension as *X, Y, Z, Z2, ZX, ZY, X2-Y2, XY*

        - Rescaled to Hz/unit-shim, where "unit-shim" refers to the measure displayed in the Adjustments card of the
          Syngo console UI, namely:

            - 1 micro-T/m for *X,Y,Z* gradients (= 0.042576 Hz/mm)
            - 1 micro-T/m^2 for 2nd order terms (= 0.000042576 Hz/mm^2)

    The returned ``basis`` is thereby in the form of ideal "shim reference maps", ready for optimization.

    Args:
        orders (numpy.ndarray): **not yet implemented** Degrees of the desired terms in the series expansion, specified
                                as a vector of non-negative integers (``[0:1:n]`` yields harmonics up to n-th order)
        x (numpy.ndarray): 3-D arrays of grid coordinates, "Right->Left" grid coordinates in the patient coordinate
                           system (i.e. DICOM reference, units of mm)
        y (numpy.ndarray): 3-D arrays of grid coordinates (same shape as x). "Anterior->Posterior" grid coordinates in
                           the patient coordinate system (i.e. DICOM reference, units of mm)

        z (numpy.ndarray): 3-D arrays of grid coordinates (same shape as x). "Inferior->Superior" grid coordinates in

        For now, ``orders`` is, in fact, ignored: fixed as [1:2]â€”which is suitable for the Prisma (presumably other
        Siemens systems as well) however, the 3rd-order shims of the Terra should ultimately be accommodated too.
        (Requires checking the Adjustments/Shim card to see what the corresponding terms and values actually are). So,
        for now, ``basis`` will always be returned with 8 terms along the 4th dim.
