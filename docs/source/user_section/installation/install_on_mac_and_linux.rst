*******************************
Installation on macOS and Linux
*******************************

``Shimming Toolbox`` can be used either from the Terminal
or from a graphical user interface (GUI) as a plugin for `FSLeyes <https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/FSLeyes>`__.

Dependencies
------------

**Optional dependencies:**

- If you would like to use ``prelude`` for phase unwrapping and/or ``bet`` for brain extraction, you need to install `FSL <https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/FslInstallation>`__.
- If you would like to use ``sct_deepseg_sc`` for spinal cord segmentation, you need to install `SCT <https://spinalcordtoolbox.com/>`__.


Installation Procedure for macOS and Linux
------------------------------------------

.. Note::

    The installer will install ``Shimming Toolbox``, ``FSLeyes`` and ``dcm2niix`` into an isolated environment.
    They will not interfere if you already have ``FSLeyes`` or ``dcm2niix`` installed. If you
    have previously installed ``FSLeyes``, that version will not support the GUI.

Open a Terminal and run the following commands.

First, download the FSLeyes plugin:

.. code:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/shimming-toolbox/fsleyes-plugin-shimming-toolbox.git

Next, run the installer:

.. code:: bash

    cd fsleyes-plugin-shimming-toolbox
    make install

You will be prompted to source your ``.*shrc`` file. For example:

.. code:: bash

    source ~/.bashrc

.. Note::

    You can restart your terminal or open a new tab to source your ``.*shrc`` file automatically.

The ``shimming-toolbox`` command launches FSLeyes with GUI support.

.. code:: bash

    shimming-toolbox

To launch our plugin, go to:

.. code:: bash

    Settings --> OrthoView --> Shimming Toolbox

The plugin should open as a panel.

Test the Installation
---------------------

This step is optional but it's a good measure to ensure
``Shimming Toolbox`` is properly installed on your system.

Comprehensive Test
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To run the entire testing suite, run ``pytest`` from the
**cloned** shimming-toolbox directory:

.. code:: bash

  cd ~/shimming-toolbox/shimming-toolbox
  source $HOME/shimming-toolbox/python/etc/profile.d/conda.sh
  conda activate ~/shimming-toolbox/python/
  pytest

See https://docs.pytest.org/ for more options.

If all tests pass, ``Shimming Toolbox`` is properly installed.


Testing subsets of soft dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``prelude`` is a soft dependencies, so you may wish to run the
parts of the testing suite that do not depend on it.

To test shimming-toolbox without ``prelude``:

.. code:: bash

  cd ~/shimming-toolbox/shimming-toolbox
  source $HOME/shimming-toolbox/python/etc/profile.d/conda.sh
  conda activate ~/shimming-toolbox/python/
  pytest -m "not prelude"

To test **only** the parts of shimming-toolbox dependent on ``prelude``, the corresponding ``-m`` argument is ``"prelude"``

For Developers
--------------

Developers have options to start developing Shimming Toolbox. A quick setup is available for those who want to quickly start coding.
While a more permanent setup is available for those who want to contribute to the project more substantially.

Quick setup
~~~~~~~~~~~

To quickly develop Shimming Toolbox, you can clone/fork the repository and run the installer.

.. code:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/shimming-toolbox/shimming-toolbox.git
    cd shimming-toolbox
    make install

You will be prompted to source your ``.*shrc`` file. For example:

.. code:: bash

    source ~/.bashrc

You can then activate the ``shimming-toolbox`` environment and start coding!

.. code:: bash

    source $HOME/shimming-toolbox/python/etc/profile.d/conda.sh
    conda activate ~/shimming-toolbox/python

Any changes you make in the **cloned** Shimming Toolbox repository should automatically be reflected in the ``shimming-toolbox`` environment.
You can test that by making  a change to the code and running the right CLI command.

Permanent setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For more permanent developers, we recommend following this `guide <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vRUfv_rG61WBnOTaQrQoteKYH1SWLjjxWOjxvZ1HnIA/edit?usp=sharing>`__ to set up a development environment.
